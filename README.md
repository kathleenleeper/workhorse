##What?
This repository/site is/are the "living" version of my Division III project @ Hampshire College. It contains my lab notebook (a  project on differentiating P19 stem cells into serotonergic neurons), my reference list (i.e. past, current, and future books & articles) with appropriate access points (i.e. PDFs or links), and written work, with past and present versions of my thesis.
The workhorse repository is the actual working version, including Jekyll plugins, so that the static HTML files can be pushed, already made, to the [github hosted site] (https://kathleenleeper.github.io)

##Why?
My Div III aims to explore open and feminist science through a model molecular/cellular neuroscience project. The lab components are as open as possible to enable following along, reliability, and ensure provenance. My written work will explore the potential implications of open data as both a liberatory power (yay!) and as a potential neocolonialist force (boo!) in an attempt to circumvent the latter and promote the former.
