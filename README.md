Why?

<p>
My Div III aims to explore open and feminist science through a model molecular/cellular neuroscience project. The lab components are as documented as I can possibly make them, as an expression and test drive of open science.
iy written work  explores the multifaceted potentials of open science: as a system to reform, empower, and re-invigorate science in the service of humanity, and as a new way of enacting age old patterns patriarchal, color- and gender-blind, neocolonialist science. </p>

This github repository and the corrsponding siteare the &quot;living&quot; version of my Division III project @ Hampshire College, relating to P19 stem cells and serotonin signalling. My thesis work is stored in a separate repository.
All of the files used to build the site can be found  at the <a href="{{site.github.repo}}workhorse">github repository</a>, if you'd like to build a version of the site yourself.
