Why?
</h2>
<p>
My Div III aims to explore open and feminist science through a model molecular/cellular neuroscience project. The lab components are as documented as I can possibly make them, as an expression and test drive of open science.
My written work  explores the potential implications of open science as both a liberatory power (yay!) and as a potential neocolonialist force (boo!) in an attempt to circumvent the latter and promote the former. Answers are, of course, not easy or simple.</p>
<br>
<p>
This repository/site is/are the &quot;living&quot; version of my Division III project @ Hampshire College. It contains my lab notebook (a project on differentiating P19 stem cells into serotonergic neurons), my reference list (i.e. past, current, and future books &amp; articles) with appropriate access points (i.e. PDFs or links), and written work, with past and present versions of my thesis.  All of the files used to build the site can be found  at the <a href="{{site.github.repo}}workhorse">github repository</a>, if you'd like to build a version of the site yourself.
