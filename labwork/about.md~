##motivations##
serotonin is rad!
<br>hallucinogens are rad because of signalling pathways! and because hallucinogens.
<br>model systems: also rad!
<br>
<p>I formerly worked with a fluorescent 5-HT2a receptor expressed in CHO cells. While certainly informative, my main concern in the project was the lack of endogenous signalling mechanisms. Since we were studying the  signalling differences caused by different drugs, not having the entire set of cell mechanisms in the right place seemed like an enormous area of potential error. </p>
<p>Thus, I'm now working with (1) readily available rat sem cells, known to differentiate into unspecified neuronal types and (2) factors obtainable from rat cDNA + common molecular biology methods.By cloning in different transcription factors known to direct cell fate towards serotonin receptor expression, my hope is to to create a model system for serotonin research with no forced overexpression or other artifacts of genetic manipulation.</p>

##general lab scheme##
The general idea:

 1. Clone transcription factors implicated in directing neuronal fate into vectors. [Mash1, Gata2, FoxA2]
 2. Transfect P19 stem cells with combinations of transcription factors.
 3. Observe!
 4. ???
 5. Profit.
