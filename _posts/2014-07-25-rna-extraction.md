{% include JB/setup %}
##intention
Lyse P19s on day 0, to get a baseline/control RNA reading of expression levels
##protocol
*does not need to be done in hood*
1. wash cells 2x with PBS -- thoroughly remove PBS
2. lyse cells in culture dish with 1 mL TRI reagant & pass cell lysate several times through a pipette
**scrape the bottom with a rubber policeman
3. transfer the TRI/lysed cells to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube; scrape all the liquid to the bottom of the dish and transfer as well
4. incubate homogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temp; store at -80 **indefinitely**
##results
