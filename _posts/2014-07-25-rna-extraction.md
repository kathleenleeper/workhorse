##intention##
Lyse P19s on day 0, to get a baseline/control RNA reading of expression levels

##protocol##
*does not need to be done in hood*<br>

  1. wash cells 2x with PBS -- thoroughly remove PBS
  2. lyse cells in culture dish with 1 mL TRI reagant & pass cell lysate several times through a pipette; scrape the bottom with a rubber policeman to ensure all cells are off
  3. transfer the TRI/lysed cells to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube; scrape all the liquid to the bottom of the dish and transfer as well
  4. incubate homogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temp; **store at -80 indefinitely**

##results?##
stored @ -80; to be purified with RNA extractions from day 3, 6, 9, 12
