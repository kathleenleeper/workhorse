##intention
After cloning the vector containing the gene of interest (Gata2, in this case), we're testing the vector in mammalian cells. P19s are fragile and don't take transfection well, so HEKs are providing a control transfection.
This is splitting one plate of HEK cells into 3 new plates, at a 1:6 dilution.

##protocol
*before* warm DMEM media to 37 C, defrost trypsin

1. Aspirate media off plate & wash HEK cells with PBS
2. add .5 mLs trypsin/0.05% EDTA
3. wait for cells to remove; add 1.5 ml DMEM/10% FBS to deactivate
4. pipette .3 mLs of cells into 3 dishes; add 1.7 mLs DMEM/10% FBS for 2 mLs total
5. label (or not)and incubate

##results
