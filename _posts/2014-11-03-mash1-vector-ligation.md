##intention

Another ligation of the eGFP1 vector and Mash1 insert after fresh digest and PCR cleanups for a plasmid to use in transfection.

##protocol

###phosphatase treatment of vector

1. combine
  * 1 &#956; l TSAP
  * 2.5 &#956; ls Multicore 10x buffer
  * 25 &#956;ls digested and purified vector (e.g. all)
 2. 15 mins, 37&deg;C
   * phosphate removal step
 3. 15 mins, 75&deg;C
   * inactivation of enzyme

###ligation

 * 2 &#956;ls ligase buffer
 * 1 &#956;ls ligase
 * 2 &#956;ls vector (from previous step)
 * 2 &#956;ls insert
   * see posts for [vector and insert]({% post_url 2014-10-30-digest-of-egfp-vector-and-mash1-inserts %})

Combine, let sit @ room temperature for 15 minutes

###transformation

Keep on ice! 

 * 50 uls HB101 cells
 * 3 uls of ligation (from previous step)

1. incubate on ice 20 minutes
 2. heat shock @ 42&deg;C for 45 seconds
 3. ice for 2 minutes 
 4. add 450 ul TB
 5. shake for @ 37&deg;Cfor 1 hour
 6. spin down and plate everything on the LB/kanamycin plates:
