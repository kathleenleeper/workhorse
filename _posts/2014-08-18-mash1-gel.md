##intention

After the restriction digest of Mash1 to cut the incorrectly-oriented vector, running the product on a 7% agarose gel to separate vector from gene and then cutting both of them out to purify and leave behind vector and gene for religation.

##protocol

###gel

Make a 7% agarose gel with a well that can accomodate ~20 uls
reagants

 * .7 g agarose
 * 100 mls TAE
 * 3 uls EthBr

loaded with a 

 * 4uls HINDIII ladder
 * ~15 uls of the Mash1/vector/loading dye

###gel purification

Done with centrifuge protocol of the Quiagen gel prep kit, ~2004 edition

##results &/or notes

Not imaged, but the gel showed two distinct bands at 700 bp and ~1400, presumably Mash1 and the vector, which were cut out with a dull-ish razorblade. The product from gel purification were nanodropped, but the nanodrop machine is broken (we think?) so no approximation of results.
