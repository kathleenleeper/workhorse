##intention

General cell maintenance from the past week of the
 * feeding
   * transfected HEKs
   * transfected P19s
   * differentiating P19s
 * splitting confluent stocks of
   * HEKs
   * P19s

##protocols

####feed transfected cells

 1. Aspirate media
 2. rinse with PBS, aspirate off
 3. add 1.5 mls media (P19 - 5% FBS MEMalpha, HEK - DMEM)

####feed differentiating P19

 1. Aspirate old media.
 2. Add 1.5 mls media (5% FBS) *should be in 1% FBS, but it's (still) not*
 3. add 1.5 uls RA 

####split HEKs & P19s

 1. Aspirate media, rinse with PBS
 2. Add .5 ml trypsin and wait for cells to shake loose
   * HEKs were incredibly confluent and thus large chunks did not come off for several minutes
   * P19s behaved more normally
 3. Add 1.5 ml media to deactivate trypsin
 4. add .3 mls cells and 1.7 mls media to each plate for a 1:6 split
   * for P19s in the future, do a 1:9 split because of the speed of growth

##results & notes
When splitting HEKs & P19s, I pipetted too violently and they hadn't really recovered by Friday. The HEKs were also over trypsinized and extremely sparse, even 3 days later.
