##intention##

Much like Aug 5, taking care of stock and transfected HEKs & P19s, and the differentiating P19s.

##protocol##

####feed/split stock cells

<p>HEKs were overtrypsinized, and just fed (1.5 mls DMEM) and put away.
P19s were overgrown and thus split (wash, add .5 mls trypsin, 1.5 to deactivate) 1:9 (.2 mls suspended cells, 1.3 mls media)</p>

####feed transfected cells

 1. Aspirate media
 2. rinse with PBS, aspirate off
 3. add 1.5 mls media (P19 - 5% FBS MEMalpha, HEK - DMEM)

<p>Transfected cells look generally starving and sad, for unclear reasons</p>

####feed differentiating P19

 1. Aspirate old media.
 2. Add 1.5 mls media (5% FBS) *should be in 1% FBS, but it's (still) not*
 3. add 1.5 uls RA 

<p> also look dying/unhealthy; this is day 14 for them though, which may explain it?</p>

##results & notes##
*Nothing yet!*
