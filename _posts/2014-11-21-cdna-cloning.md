##intention

Post-return from the SfN conference, rerunning [11/11 PCRs]({% post_url 2014-11-11-cdna-clones %}) with a different pipetting setup.

##protocol

| reagant | 5'-3', 25 &956;l rxn | 5' | 3' | rxns x3 mm|
|---------------------|----------------------|------|------|--------------|
| 5' | .5 | .5 | - | 1.5 |
| 3' | .5 |  -  | .5 | 1.5 |
| RPE cDNA | .5 | .5 | .5 | 1.5 |
| dNTPs | .5 | .5 | .5 | 1.5 |
| 10x DreamTaq buffer | 2.5 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 7.5 |
| DreamTaq | .3 | .3 | .6 | .9 |
| ddH20 | 20.2 | 20.7 | 20.7 | 60.6 or 62.1 |

| temp | time    |     |

##results &/or notes

The PCR machine fritzed on the first step of the cycle and samples were at ~94&deg; for approximately 20 minutes before I discovered the error. Seems to have run okay.

Gel conclusion: The DreamTaq isn't good enough at proofreading. Also strange is that the 5'-3' has bright bands at 1400, but none at 700 like the 3' does.
