##intention

Continue to differentiate P19s, and add Trizol to one dish for later RNA extraction
##protocol

###differentiation

 1. Aspirate media; do not wash cells, as they're delicate little babies.
 2. Add 1.5 mls MEMalpah with 5% FBS *1% during next diff.*, and 1.5 uls RA

###trizol extraction

 1. wash cells 2x with PBS -- thoroughly remove PBS
 2. lyse cells in culture dish with 1 mL TRI reagant & pass cell lysate several times through a pipette; scrape the bottom with a rubber policeman to ensure all cells are off
 3. transfer the TRI/lysed cells to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube; scrape all the liquid to the bottom of the dish and transfer as well
 4. incubate homogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temp; **store at -80 indefinitely**
