##intention

Clean up the restriction digest, then ligate and transform it in to E. coli.

##protocol


###PCR cleanup

Cleanup according to the [QIAquick PCR Purification kit](http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit); DNA eluted with 30 uls ddH<sub>2</sub>O

###ligation

 * 5 uls ligase buffer
 * 1 ul ligase
 * 1.5 ul vector
 * 2.5 ul insert

Combine, let sit @ room temperature for 15 minutes

###transformation

Keep on ice! 
 * 50 uls H101 cells
 * 3 uls of ligation

1. incubate on ice 20 minutes

 2. heat shock @ 42&deg;C for 45 seconds
 3. ice for 2 minutes 

 4. add 450 ul TB
 5. shake for @ 37&deg;Cfor 1 hour
 6. plate 50 uls on LB/kanamycin plates:

##results
No colonies grew, so re-attempt the ligation & subsequent transformation
