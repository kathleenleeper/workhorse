##intention

Pick screened colonies and grow them up to have bacteria in bulk.

##protocol

In centrifuge tube, combine
 * 3 mLs luria broth
 * 3 uls kanamycin
 * one pipette tip with picked colony

Shake @ 37* C, 200 rpm, overnight

##results &/or notes

Incubator was set at 60* C, so all of the little bacteria fried to death.
Put the plate back in the incubator to let it regrow and recover from my really terrible colony-picking technique, re-did the following day. 2 of the 6 colonies clouded up and were used in the following days screens.
