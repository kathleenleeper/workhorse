##intention

Colonies from [the 10/18 ligation and transformation]({% post_url 2014-10-18-mash1-ligation-transformation %}) didn't grow; possibly because the insert DNA was so dilute (0.6 and very messy on the nanodrop.)
Re-running the ligation after reducing the volume of the water/DNA by 2/3 (to 15 uls, ~13.9 ng/ul)

##protocol

| DNA | concentration |
|----------| --------------------|
|vector | 19.5 |
|Mash1 insert &nbsp;&nbsp;| 13.9* |

*after vacuum drying and resuspension

|reagant | uls |
|------------| -----| 
|  <s>ligase buffer</s> |<s>5 uls</s> |
| 2x ligase buff &nbsp; | 4.9
| ligase&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1 |
|vector | 1.2 |
|insert/buffer | 1.07| 

Accidentally added the 5 uls of ligase buffer to the 15 uls of insert instead of the empty tube, bringing that concentration down to 10.425 ng/ul -- desired mm is 11.17 ng (as calculated via Promega Restriction protocol), so use 1.07 uls insert, and 4.9 uls buffer to account for the buffe already in the insert.

Combine, let sit @ room temperature for 15 minutes
