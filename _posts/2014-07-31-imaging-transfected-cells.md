##intention

Check the fluorescence of HEK + Gata2 and P19s + GFP 
##protocol/what happened

 1. wash cells with PBS
  * cells then sat in PBS for ~10 minutes in the hood while the media warmed up
 2. aspirate PBS, add 1.5 mls clean media (5% FBS  MEMalpha to P19s, DMEM to HEKs)
  * back in incubator to recover from alkalization
 3. imaged, but cells were still cold and alkaline

##results & notes

*Nothing yet!*
