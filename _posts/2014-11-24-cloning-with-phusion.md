##intention

DreamTaq is, realistically, pretty subpar Taq. One of the advanced methods lab students recently ordered Phusion Taq for his cloning, which I'm allowed to appropriate as a Div III, and because John told me I could. So we'll see if this does a better job at accurately cloning.

##protocol

| reagant | per 25 &#956;l rxn | x2.5 rxns |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| 5' | .5 | 1.25 |
| 3' | .5 | 1.25 |
| RPE cDNA | .5 | .5 |
| 2x Phusion MM | 12.5 | 31.25 |
| ddH<sub>2</sub>0 | 6 (6.5) * | 15 (16.25) * |

This was run with the usual 5'-3', 3', and 5' negative controls.  I initially calculated the H<sub>2</sub>0 concentrations for a 20 &#956;l reaction, and forgot to change this when I decided to do 25 &#956;l reaction instead.

| temp&deg; | time | repeat |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 98 | 30s |  |
| 98 | 10 s | x10 |
| 59 | 10s | x10 |
| 72 | 20s | x10 |
| then |||
| 98 | 10s | x25 |
| 72 | 20s | x25 |
| 72 | 3 min |  |
| 4 |  |  |
