###Why?

P19 stem cells differentiate into neuron-like cells when exposed to 1 mM trans-retinoic acid (RA). While RA technically only needs to be added for the first 3 days or so to set cell fate, we keep it on RA.

###protocol

####reagants

 * retinoic acid (-20 C freezer, in the corner with trypsin; kept in tinfoil to prevent light exposure and degradation)
 * MEMalpha with 1% FBS
 * sparse-ish P19, preferably at a low pass number

####do:

 1. Take off any current media (typically 5%) and wash the cells with PBS gently (if this is Day 0 of differentiation). P19s throw off a lot of stuff.
 2. Add 1.5 mls MEMalpha with 1% FBS
  * the less FBS, the better they differentiate, but also the faster they die. Its a balance. 
 3. Add 1.5 uls of the RA to the center of the dish; swirl!
  * a cool thing happens where the RA must be very hydrophobic, so a tiny clear spot will appear where you pipette it in

 4. Do this again 3 days later!
  * P19s are delicate infants; please don't wash them if they're in the process of throwing out processes.

Differentiated P19s aren't useful after day 20 or so, so get rid of them or something afterwards.
