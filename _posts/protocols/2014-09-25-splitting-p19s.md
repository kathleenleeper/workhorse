###why?

sometimes cells are too confluent and we need less of them! P19s grow fast, so even with a 1:9 split (no counting @ Hampshire), they need to be split every 5-6 days, and fed every three days.

###do

####reagants

 * MEMalpha, with some percent FBS depending on your task. 5% for normal maintenance.
 * trypsin

  1. Aspirate media, rinse with PBS
  2. Add .5 ml trypsin and wait for cells to shake loose
   * if you're not me, you'll actually let them hang out in the incubator and dissociate properly
   3. Add 1.5 ml media to deactivate trypsin
   4. add .2 mls cells and 1.8 mls media to each plate for a ~1:9 split

Incubate those suckers for a coupla days. Typically they'll need feeding 3 days later, splitting in 6-7.
