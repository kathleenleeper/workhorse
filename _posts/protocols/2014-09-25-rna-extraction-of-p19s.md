###Why?
Extracting, isolating, and quantiating RNA expression allows us to build a timeline of the "usual" P19 differentiation expression levels, and then compare it to what happens with the introduction of different transcription factors. Step 1: Kill cells, collect cell lysate to later do an RNA extraction en masse.

###Do

 1. Wash cells in 35mm dish 2x with PBS (wash= add ~1ml PBS and aspirate).
   * unless you're using delicate cells that don't need washing, like delicate differentiating P19s
  2. Add 1 mL of TRIZOL Reagent to the dish and pipette up and down to make sure all the cells are really dead and really broken up. 
  4. Scrape TRIZOL/lysed cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge; scrape! Get ALL of the stuff.
 5. Incubate the homÂ­ogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temperature 
   * the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. 

<b> Store the suspension @ -80, label with date & other pertinent information </b>
