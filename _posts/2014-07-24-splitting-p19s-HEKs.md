{% include JB/setup %}
##intention

 * Splitting 2 dishes of P19 cells into 10 dishes, in preparation for differentation and RNA extraction, and transfection
 * splitting one plate of HEK cells into 3 new plates, at a 1:6 dilution, for testing Gata2 vector

##protocols##
###P19s###
 * **beforehand** warm media & trypsin to 37 C; label 10 plates

 1. wash cells with PBS
 2. add .5 ml .05% trypsin in EDTA; swirl & check at ~30 second intervals for removal
 3. deactivate with 2mls MEMalpha with 5% FBS
 4. combine plates; mix gently for even cell distribution
 5. plate .2 mls of cells into 10 little itty plates
 6. add 1.3 mls to each dish
 7. toss into incubator for differentation protocol starting the next day.

###HEKs

 * *before* warm DMEM media to 37 C, defrost trypsin

 1. Aspirate media off plate & wash HEK cells with PBS
 2. add .5 mLs trypsin/0.05% EDTA
 3. wait for cells to remove; add 1.5 ml DMEM/10% FBS to deactivate
 4. pipette .3 mLs of cells into 3 dishes; add 1.7 mLs DMEM/10% FBS for 2 mLs total
 5. label (or not) and incubate

##results
*Nothing yet!*
