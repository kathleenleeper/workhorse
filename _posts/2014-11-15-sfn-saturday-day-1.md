##technical details

<p>left bethesda @ 10ish, in DC around 11ish, coffee & computer camping @ Chinatown Coffee Co. until a little before 1. Excellent coffee, 10/10 would recommend. Picked up badges @ the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, after some confusion and overwhelming-ness over whether we had to re-register, and headed to the downstairs poster hall. WOW SO MUCH SCIENCE. SO MUCH NEURO. Insert word cloud here.</p>

Posters of note: 
 
 * Gonzalez-Maeso lab, although with no one there to explain it, on the mGlu2-HT2aR heterodimerization.
 *  A post doc @ the Roth lab, UNC Chapel Hill, on the effect of knocking down P90 ribosomal <i>something</i> on rat reaction to drug. Responsible for phosphorylation of Ser-315 in 5-HT2a; that phosphorylation attentuates response to drugs, so knockdown of the P90 ribosomal protein leads to increased response to PCP and DOI, as well as increased gene transcription and translation (c-Fos)
 * Also wandereded by the "zeds", i.e. the educational neuroscience ones. Kathleen's favorites, and frustratingly not given a big enough spot. 
 * Other highlights: the NIH's <i>beautiful</i> immunofluorescensce poster. </p>

###notes I have

It's WILD being with so many scientists. So many people in a field I nominally want to be a part of. So much money, and so many people's lives and efforts trying to be condensed into a little piece of paper.

Representation, on a numbers basis, seems honestly better than expected. By the end of today, there were 30,056 people at SfN over the course of the day. Enormous! Bigger tomorrow! But it seems, just from a very cursory glance around, attendees are fairly equal in their gender distribution, as well as poster presenters, although I think those lean towards male domination. 

At the Presidential Keynote lecture, all 4 of the people who spoke or walked across the stage read as women, albeit read as white women.

Re: race, SfN is overwhelmingly white, South Asian, or East Asian.

Joel says he noticed differences in how people paid attention to the three of us; at at least one poster, Joel said it seemed like one post-doc was referring to him even when I was asking questions.

I think there's two questions that I find, at least, interesting.

 1. enormous focus and use of motifs of cells and molecules -- like, incorporated into design
 2. what <i> should </i> I get out of a poster? How do people process posters? What's the "right" way to do it?

##angry-making things 

A poster on the neurobiology of the comorbid anxiety and anorexia "primarily seen in young adolescent girls", using <i>female rats </i> as a model system. 

Why the fuck would <i>female rats</i> be a functional system for <i>anorexia</i>? If studying starvation, study starvation, and do not throw gender into the equation unless you are "controlling" for gender, fuck. Why would female rats be a good model for anorexia? Anorexia is <i>entirely created by our cultur </i>. That does not  make it less real, just not replicable in <i>model systems</i>.

During the introduction to the Presidential Lecture (by Kelsey C. Martin), the introducer said "...[studies this in] healthy brians, which f course has implications for diseased brains." I hate the distinction and boundary between healthy and diseased. Not a binary! Binaries are very rarely real! 

Also a reference to the "laypeople" that we should be doing outreach to. Again, there is no mass group of laypersons just waiting to be given neuroscience. It is just that  people who have chosen t spend their time on different things.

##cool science things!

I still love serotonin, and hallucinogens, and those mechanisms. 


There is a lab at Rockefeller, studying the mGlu2 receptor as a drug target to treat depression by epigenetic modification. Apparently very effective at allowing rats to react with less stress markers to stress tests. <i> Not </i> helping rats manage depression, because, well, it's a rat <i> model</i> of depression.

Apparently there's an assay for rats called a nosepoke. Model for fear and anxiety, specifically testing the "fear avoidance".

Project Brain Flight, at the Max Planck Institute of Biology, is gamifying brain research and feeding their results back in to make the game better. 

##grad schools

For some reason, all of this is making me feel better about grad school. I think its exposing me to a lot of good science happening at places I don't think about often in the context of science. For example, though, I saw a number of really interesting papers on pharmacological signalling from Emory University -- which of course is where Angela Willey did her feminist work on polyamorous voles and where Deboleena Roy teaches, and many from McGill, which besides being in a great city has a number of writers from the critical/open science world.

Current thoughts:

 * McGill (Montreal, CA)
 * Emory (Atlanta, Georgia, USA)
 * Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology (Berlin?)
 * UNC Chapel Hill
 * MIT, ofc
