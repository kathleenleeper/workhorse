##intention##
Based on the screening results from the 9th, Gata2 is in the CMV-SV40 vector the right way! Hurray.
But there's not enough DNA, so this is a transformation into bacterial JM109 cells. There's a kanamycin resistant gene in the vector, so the bacteria are grown on LB plates with kanamycin in them. 

##protocol##
combine:<ul>
<li>25 ul bacteria, thawed and kept on ice</li>
<li>2 ul vector [10 ng]</li>
</ul>
then<ol>
<li> incubate on ice 20 minutes</li>
<li> heat shock @ 42 C for 45 seconds</li>
<li> ice for 2 minutes </li>
<li> add 450 ul TB, shake for @ 37 C for 1 hour</li>
<li> plate on LB/kanamycin plates:</li></ol>
<small><ul><li>10 uls resuspension</li>
<li>50 uls resuspension</li>
<li> the rest!</li>
</ul></small>
<p>left upside down overnight @ 37 C; placed in 4 C fridge the next day</p>
