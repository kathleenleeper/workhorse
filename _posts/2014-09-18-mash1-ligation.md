##intention

Ligate Mash1 and vector again and then transform E. coli, cross our fingers that one of the colonies has a properly-inserted vector.

##protocol

####ligation 

Reagants:

 * 5 uls ligase buffer
 * 1 ul ligase
 * 1.5 uls vector
 * 2.5 insert
   * both quantities should be calculated, but the nanodrop is still broken so actual amounts are pretty up in the air
 
 1. combine reagants and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes
 2. transform into e. coli immediately

####transformation

Reagants:

 * 50 uls bacteria (JM109s****, or their close counterparts)
 * 3 uls ligation product
 * Terrific Broth (TB)

Keep cells on ice always.

 1. Combine bacteria and ligation product and incubate on ice 20 minutes
 2. heat shock at 42* C for 45 seconds
 3. immediately back on ice for 2 minutes
 4. add 450 uls TB and shake at 37*C for 1 hr
 5. plate 150 uls on LB/kanamycin plates; leave in the incubator overnight

##results &/or notes
*Nothing yet!*
