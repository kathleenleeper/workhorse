##intention##
<p>Splitting 2 dishes of P19 cells into 10 dishes, in preparation for a basic baseline setting of gene expression after differentiation with retinoic acid</p>
<!-- more -->

##protocol##
*  before: warm media & trypsin to 37 C; label 10 plates
<br><br>
  1. wash cells with PBS
  2. add .5 ml .05% trypsin in EDTA; swirl & check at ~30 second intervals for removal
  3. deactivate with 2mls MEMalpha with 5% FBS
  4. combine plates; mix gently for even cell distribution
  5. plate .2 mls of cells into 10 little itty plates
