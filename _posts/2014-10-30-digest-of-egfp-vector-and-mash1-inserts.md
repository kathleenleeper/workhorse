##intention

Since colonies have been growing despite the vector being digested and treated with phosphatase, it's possible the [initial EcoRI digest]({% post_url 2014-10-23-cutting-new-vector %}) wasn't successful. The new [Mash1 inserts]({% post_url 2014-10-29-mash1-pcr %}) also need cutting.

##protocol

Combine the following amounts, mix, and let sit overnight at 37&deg;

###inserts

Both inserts  (from [10/14 cloning]({% post_url 2014-10-15-cloning-mash1-from-rat-cdna %}) and [10/29]({% post_url 2014-10-29-mash1-pcr %})) are sub 5 ng/ &#956;l DNA concentration, so 
 
 * 17 &#956;ls insert
 * 1 &#956;ls FD EcoRI
 * 2 &#956;ls FD buffer

### vector
 
concentration: 27.3 ng/&#956;l

 * 4 &#956;l vector
 * 1 &#956;l enzyme
 * 2 &#956;l buffer
 * 13 &#956;l H<sub>2</sub>0 (for total volume of 20 &#956;ls)

###cleanup

With the [QIAquick purification kit](http://www.qiagen.com/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-pcr-purification-kit), to remove EcoRI enzymes
