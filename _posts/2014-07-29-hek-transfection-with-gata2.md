##intention##
Two goals: Transfecting the Gata2 vector (CMV - Gata2 - GFP - SV40) into HEK cells, to see if and how the vector works.
P19s are difficult to transfect and prone to death, so we're just trying two methods (fugene & "Lipofectamine 3000") to see if either is effective.

##protocol##

###HEKs: Fugene + Gata2###

 * 187 uls serum free media (SFM) *used SFMEMalpha instead of DMEM, but shouldn't be an issue because it's a very small volume*
 * 6 uls Fugene
 * 7 uls GATA2
<br><br>

*all sterilely in hood*

 1. Add SFM to 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
 2. add Fugene directly to media, without touching the sides of the tubes; mix by gentle tapping 
 3. add DNA
 4. incubate 10 minutes @ room temperature; add mixture to cells dropwise

###P19s###

####Fugene + GFP####

 * 184 uls SFM *MEMalpha*
 * 6 uls Fugene
 * 10 uls pEGFPN1
<br>
**protocol same as above**

####Lipofectamine + GFP####

 * **Tube A**: mix 125 uls SFM and 3.75 uls lipofectamine
 * **Tube B**: mix 125 uls SFM, 3.2 uls siRNA (or DNA), 3.2 uls P30* reagant

 1. Add tube A to B, mix
 2. Incubate 5 minutes
 3. Add dropwise to cells

##results & notes##

*P30 is a proprietary reagant mix
