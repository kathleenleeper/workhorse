##intention

Run the same sequence of protocols as [the earlier transformation]({% post_url 2014-10-23-mash1-and-new-vector %}), after
 
 * making sure TSAP is inactive
 * doubling vector and insert concentrations

##protocol

####inactivating TSAP

Put @ 72&deg;C for 15 mins

### ligation

|reagant | &#956;ls |
|------------| -----| 
| 2x ligase buff &nbsp; | 4.6 |
| ligase&nbsp;&nbsp; | 1 |
|vector | 2.2 |
|insert/buffer | 2.2 | 

<br>
Combine, let sit @ room temperature for 15 minutes

###transformation

 * On ice - 
  * 50 uls HB101 cells
  * 3 uls of new ligation

1. incubate on ice 20 minutes
 2. heat shock @ 42&deg;C for 45 seconds
 3. ice for 2 minutes 
 * add 450 ul TB
 5. shake for @ 37&deg;Cfor 1 hour
 6. plate all on one LB/kanamycin plate

##results &/or notes
Multiplicity of colonies on the plate, but after screening CMV 5' - SV40 3', all signals were ~700 (6 colonies).
