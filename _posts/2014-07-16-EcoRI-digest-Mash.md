title: EcoR1 restriction digest of M5
category: labwork

intent: digesting the incorrectly oriented Mash1 vector
tags: [iteration-1, Mash1]

##intention##
Based on the screening results from the 9th, Mash-1 is in the CMV-SV40 vector backwards, from 3'-5'.It needs to be digested [taken out of the vector], and re-inserted the right way!

##protocol##
**DNA concentration**: 246 ng/ul
**volume DNA**: ~6 uls

<i> 246 ng/ul * 2 ul = 500 ng DNA </i>

<TABLE>
<TR> <TH>reagant </TH> <TH>per 500 ng DNA  <TH>x3</TH> </TR>

<TR> <TD>10x EcoRI buffer</TD> <TD>1</TD><TD>3</TD> </TR>
<TR> <TD>EcoRI enzyme</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>3</TD>
</TABLE>

Combine, put at 37 C for 1 hour, put into 4 C fridge.

##results##
*mistakes made* the EcoR1 reagants used were the kind that go in the waterbath overnight, not for an hour, so the digest failed almost entirely.
