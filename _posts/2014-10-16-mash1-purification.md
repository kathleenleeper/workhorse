##intention

Run all 38 uls of the Mash1 cDNA product on a gel, cut it out, and purify it to get the pure Mash1 product

##protocol

####gel

Run a gel (.75% agarose & TAE) & cut out the bands on a UV screen.

 * 2 gel fragments; both over 400 mg, split into tubes A1, A2, and B1, B2

####purify

Run a gel purification using the [QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit](http://www.qiagen.com/us/products/catalog/sample-technologies/dna-sample-technologies/dna-cleanup/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit)

####gel

 * ending with 60 uls DNA in each tube (A + B)
 * running 10 uls of each on a gel to see which sample is Mash1 and which is primer dimer
