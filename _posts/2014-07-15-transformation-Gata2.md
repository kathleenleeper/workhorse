title: transformation of Gata2 vector into bacteria

intent: transforming properly oriented Gata2 vector into competent e. coli
---

##intention##

Based on the screening results from the 9th, Gata2 is in the CMV-SV40 vector the right way! Hurray.
But there's not enough DNA, so this is a transformation into bacterial JM109 cells. There's a kanamycin resistant gene in the vector, so the bacteria are grown on LB plates with kanamycin in them. 

##protocol##


 * **mix**
   * 25 ul bacteria, thawed and kept on ice
   * 2 ul vector [10 ng]
 
 1. incubate on ice 20 minutes
 2. heat shock @ 42 C for 45 seconds
 3. ice for 2 minutes 
 4. add 450 ul TB, shake for @ 37 C for 1 hour
 5. plate on LB/kanamycin plates:
 * 10 uls resuspension
 * 50 uls resuspension
 * the rest!

left upside down overnight @ 37 C; placed in 4 C fridge the next day

##results##

*Nothing yet!*
