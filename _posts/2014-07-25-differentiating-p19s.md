##intention

Add retinoic acid to 6 P19 plates split on July 24, to start the differentiation process and collect baseline RNA samples throughout the process.
##protocol

 1. Aspirate media from dishes, rinse gently with PBS.
 2. Add 1.5 mLs MEMalpha with 5% FBS *should have been 1%, but not aware of that at the time*
 3. Add 1.5 uls retinoic acid to each dish, swirl, back in the incubator @ 37 C.

##results & notes
*Nothing yet!*
