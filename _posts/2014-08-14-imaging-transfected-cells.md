##intention

 * image (confocal) the methanol-fixed cells
 * extract (via Trizol) RNA from differentiating P19s; day 6
 * feed differentiating and stock P19s/HEKs

##protocols

see general protocol

##results &/or notes

 * rebuilt the vacuum pump for the tissue culture hood; now it works marginally better
 * left RA out in the hood from Aug 11, so I need to make more

###imaging the transfected cells

Cells were mostly dead from overconfluence, so background fluorescense was really high.
Also, added MeOH 3 days earlier and it evaporated, dehydrating the cells.
lipofectamine + P19 cells were more alive than the other two dishes, but didn't express GFP (probably due to not enough bad technique in the initial transfection)

###cell culture
 * HEKs: spidery, sparse, but healthy
 * day 6 diff. P19s: clumpy but okay, in 1% media this time around, and generally sparse
 * stock P19s: ~80% confluent, healthy
